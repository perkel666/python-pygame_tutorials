		[EVENT:st001]

	[SPEAKER:PLAYER]

What is happening ? Hmm ? Who thought it will be good idea to be here ?
Damn......      I wish i had comfy clothes.

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

I said to you earlier it will be cold.

	[SPEAKER:PLAYER]

Sod off ! I never thought it will be THIS cold !...

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

Either way we need to move. They are still close and our tracks are visible clear as day.

		[EVENT:st002]

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

I think we are getting into ambush. We should change our course.

	[SPEAKER:PERKEL]

What ambush !?

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

Look at way ahead. Road is easily visible and on each sides
there are thick bushes that can hide even balista in them.

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

We should go through woods instead of using this road.
It will be much safer this way.

	[SPEAKER:PLAYER]

But it will slow as down.

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]

Yes, but i think you wouldn't want to earn a bolt in your ass.

	[SPEAKER:PLAYER]

...

	[SPEAKER:PLAYER]

No i wouldn't...

	[SPEAKER:GILFORD]


Then let us go through the woods.
