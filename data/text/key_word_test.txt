What is happening ? Hmm ? Who thought it will be good idea to be here ?
Damn......      I wish i had comfy clothes.
[GILFORD]
I said to you earlier it will be cold.
[PLAYER]
Sod off ! I never thought it will be THIS cold !...
[GILFORD]
Either way we need to move. They are still close and our tracks are visible clear as day.

	[EVENT:st002]
[GILFORD]
I think we are getting into ambush. We should change our course.
[PERKEL]
What ambush !?
[GILFORD]
Look at way ahead. Road is easily visible and on each sides
there are thick bushes that can hide even balista in them.
[GILFORD]
We should go through woods instead of using this road.
It will be much safer this way.
[PLAYER]
But it will slow as down.
[GILFORD]
Yes, but i think you wouldn't want to earn a bolt in your ass.
[PLAYER]
...
[PLAYER]
No i wouldn't...
[GILFORD]
Then let us go through the woods.
